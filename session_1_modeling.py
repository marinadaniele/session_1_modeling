# object-oriented programming (OOP)
# data science, regressions, time series, applicable coding.
# OOP: different way of looking at programming.
# Programming paradigm: a philosophy or style of programming.
# We map real life situations into programming language.
# we use objects to model our problem and solve it.
# We structure programs in a way such as properties bundled together in an object.
# car: wheels, engines, doors, windows...
# we model these objects in as objects which have data and methods (functions) they can perform.

# class: a blueprint for creating objects.
# Everything in python is an object

    # each object has:
        # a type
        # an internal data representation
        # a set of procedures for interacting with the object.

# def defines a function, class defines and object / class
# capitalize the first letter of the class name for convention to distinguish it from a function.
